This project demonstrates a responsive web layout using HTML, CSS, and little JavaScript. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using responsive design techniques such as CSS Flexbox and media queries. The layout also features a sticky footer that remains at the bottom of the page, regardless of the content length.
